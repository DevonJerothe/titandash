# Titandash

A python bot used to automate the mobile game TapTitans2.

The Django web framework is used to wrap the entire bot functionality
into a dashboard type system with real time updates and data persistence.

More information can be found at [titanda.sh](https://titanda.sh)

This is a development README and will not be bundled in distribution copies of
the built project.

An authentication system is placed on top of the Bot and used to bootstrap
initialization, that system is bundled with the web page used to purchase
tokens and sign up for the system.

The repository for that can be found [here](https://github.com/becurrie/titanauth)
